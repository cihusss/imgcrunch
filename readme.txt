Hello stranger.

1) Get py2app: https://py2app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
2) Make sure you have python 2.x on your MacOs machine

Compile into a stand-alone MacOS app using the following command in your terminal:

"python setup.py py2app"

If all goes well your app will appear in the "dist" folder.

Cheers!
Teo
